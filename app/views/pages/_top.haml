            %p Our staff is truly committed to each of our residents and want to impart our own experience, knowledge, and empowerment to our residents to help them be successful in their recovery process. We believe therapy alone is not enough for someone recovering from addiction. We have an alternative approach as we believe life skills, support, and safe environment, in addition to therapy will help someone to gain the independence they are seeking.
